# Weather Dashboard

## Description
This project was created so we can show how to use an api and get its data to show
up on a webpage. It should also be able to show specific city weather depending
on which city the user types in to the search bar. It should also show the weather for the next 5 following days. Previous searched cities should also be stored in local storage and be able to be seen again if pressed on under the search bar.
